Low fret signal is interpreted as hairpin opened.
When low fret signal dwells, RPA is considered to diffuse freely in the opened hairpin region.
Once the hairpin closes, low fret signals disappear.
Dwell time of low fret signals can be found by simulation.
The parameter that generates most "similar" results, as measured by [relative entropy between distributions], is adopted as the true data.
